          <h2>HEMPCRETELOGIC. ICELANDICRETE</h2>
          <p>Icelandic bio material research</p>
          <p>Yes! The core of this research is Hemp (Cannabis Sativa L) and yes, since 2020, growing
            industrial hemp is officially allowed in Iceland!</p>
          <p><i>Cannabis Sativa L</i>
            -
            is a flowering
            annual plant
            and one of the earliest known cultivated plants.
            Now this
            multipurpose crop is cultivated all over the world, all parts of hemp can be
            potentially usable for the production of many different commodities with industrial interest
            from the agric
            ultural to food and feed, cosmetic and building. Indeed, from this highly versatile
            plant, it is possible to obtain various products such as fiber and shives; bio
            -
            building and
            thermal insulated materials; seeds, flour and oil with important nutritional and
            functional
            features; and bio active compounds of pharmacological interest.</p>
            <p>Even though all parts of hemp can be used, in this research I focus only on usability of hemp
              stem shives.</p>
            <p>The hemp stem can reach a height of more than four meters when the plant
              has good growth
              conditions. The outside of the stem is covered with bark, also called epidermis. Inside the
              hemp stems are bast fibers and the woody core, called
              shives.</p>
            <p>By mixing hemp shives
              with water and lime, we get a building material called hempcrete.</p>
            <p>Hempcrete has a range of desirable thermal, structural and moisture
              -
              handling properties that
              make for an excellent building insulation material. Depending on the mix variables, hempcrete
              c
              an be used as roof, wall and/or slab insulation</p>
            <p>The main goal of this project is to find local Icelandic biomaterial compounds that will reduce
              the use of lime in the hempcrete mix, since lime is not a local natural resource in Iceland.</p>
            <p>So lets take a l
              ook what biomaterials Iceland offers to reduce lime usage in hempcrete
              mixture.</p>
            <h2>VOLCANIC MATTER</h2>
            <p>Iceland is a volcanic island, formed by eruptions caused by the sea floor spreading
              in the middle of the
              Atlantic Ocean. It sits on the convergent rim, with t
              he plate boundary running right through the island.
              The plates move from here to the east and to the west, continually increasing the (geographic) distance
              between Europe and America. The space is filled by basaltic lava coming up from the Earth's mantle.
              As
              a result, there are volcanic rocks like basalt and tufa, and sedimentary rocks, formed by erosion of
              volcanic rocks. Especially the large glaciers of the island produce a decent amount of moraine. However,
              there are no soluble rocks like limestone or gy
              psum, which are formed as biogen sedimentary rocks.
              There are no reefs so far to the north, which would produce reef limestone.</p>
            <p>
              Limestone is not found in Iceland, though you will find something called Icelandic spar, a transparent
              variety of calcite, or c
              rystallized calcium carbonate, in Reyðarfjörður fjord near East Iceland. In fact,
              only 8
              -
              10% of the rock in Iceland is sedimentary, the classification of rock that includes limestone.</p>
            <h2>MARINE MATTER</h2>
            <p>Another object of research in the search for binding ma
              terials is seaweeds
              –
              marine algae.
              The
              Icelandic coast is a rich resource of many edible and industrially usable seaweeds. Since the settlement
              of Iceland, several species have been used for human consumption, as animal fodder, as manure and for
              different
              other purposes.</p>
            <p>As photosynthesising organisms, seaweed absorb carbon dioxide from their surroundings, as oxygen
              and energy are formed with the help of sunlight. Recent studies show that seaweed cover 2% of the
              Earth’s surface but are thought to absorb
              up to 70% of global emitted CO
              2
              . Additionally, seaweed play
              a huge role in Silica, Phosphorus and Nitrogen cycles, along with breaking down natural compounds
              which other organisms are able to use in chemical compounds and processes. In this case I am
              inves
              tigating different seaweed species that produces the most natural glue that could be used as
              biomaterial mixture binder.</p>
