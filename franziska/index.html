            So I'm going to tell you about what I've been working on.
            For the last semester I've been investigating artificial intelligence. I was particularly interested in what AI looks like and what it is. Like does it have a body? Is it just a neural network? Doesn't it have a form? Is it an avatar?
            I went out there and saw what open AI’s are publicly available. I started by basically dating an AI because I wanted to know more about it. So I asked very typical dating questions: What do you look like? What's your favorite color? And stuff like that.
            After having various conversations with popular open source AI’s, I noticed that the outcome of the question “What do you look like” was predominant the picture of a white female.
            That was very surprising to me, so I dove more into that topic: Why does it see itself as a white female?
          </p>
          <p>
            I came across this whole gender debate and the basis and risks of AI. This was really interesting because in order to understand that, you have to look at how AI is trained.
            Us humans feed it with data on which it is trained on. By the way an AI makes a huge amount of mistakes while training. It is far from perfect when first being trained.
            It constantly has to reevaluate: “Is that correct?”.
            But that highly depends on what we feed it – what it is training on. The beliefs of the AI are dependent on what beliefs you feed it. So you strongly control it. And at the beginning of artificial intelligence, when its inventors trained it, they weren't aware that this was going to be an issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of risks and biases: for some people, the face-recognition apps didn't recognize their skin color. So it could only be properly used by white people. And that obviously raised a lot of disturbance and this whole debate heated it up more.
            They just fed the AI with data about western white people and nothing else. Nowadays they are obviously much more aware of it. So now they always include disclaimers: be aware of this bias. The AI is trained on this database and then you can look up what are the risks or what is included and excluded in the dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            But still, if it's an open AI that everyone can just use, it's going to give you the result of someone who created the database.
            There are people that feed the database. For example you can get a job making descriptions, especially for pictures. You have to describe what is on the picture in order for the machine to understand what is on the picture, because the machine doesn't know what an apple looks like. Even if you see multiple images of an apple, you have to write down a description in order for it to understand that this thing is supposed to be an apple. That is  similar to an archive. If you look for something, you have to write down what is in there. And so people are being paid to write down what you can see on the picture. It depends on what good of a job they do, for the quality of the database. But this is a highly underpaid job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping everything I discovered in mind I wanted to see more of what it could look like and fed it, prompts like 3D shape, organic being, artificial intelligence or some abstract version of that. And then it gave me various forms and shapes. I have a whole feed of it.
          </p>
          <video muted loop autoplay src="assets/Franzizka_IMG_7166.mp4"></video>
          <p>
            I took it a step further to the understanding of it beeping a neural network, machine learning. Using a pen plotter I created drawings of these forms and shapes in the style of networks. The question raised, that this is not what AI looks like, but rather again what I feed it and what I want the AI to look like by giving it these specific prompts.
            I decided on the prompts, so in a way I am deciding on what the outcome is going to be. In comparison: when I just asked “How do you look like?” it created those photos of white females, but when I asked about “artificial Intelligence” it showed me drawings of humanoid robot gender fluid looking beings, something I would consider as stereotypical images of artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that was an outcome I didn't want because I was questioning “why does it has to be a human?” “Why does it have to look like an avatar?” That is the reason why I asked for 3D shapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now I am back to dating it and investigating how it looks.
            I'm going to look more into the theme of dating it and seeing what I can find out about it.
            So I am looking into scanning myself and creating an avatar of myself to get on the same level as am AI. Right now I am not on the same level as the AI. So the way of gaining access to it is by becoming an AI myself.
            There is the question of consent though. Does AI want to date me? Why am I assuming it would like to date a white female human?        </p>
            <p>
            As a side project, I looked at fonts and typography. Typography has a feel to it. It gives you a certain tone, a certain vibe.
            I asked the AI to create fonts. I am turning these letters into a resource booklet, that can give typedesigners a new source of inspiration inn finding new shapes.  I did a booklet now with a, I created fonts and not whole fonts, like it gave me whole fonts, but I just use like snippets of it. Like just one letter and yeah, I just use it now. It's like inspiration, like know inspiration for future fonts.
