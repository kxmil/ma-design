            I think I will replace some of these objects eventually. The only thing that I'm sure of is this twig. It is a dowsing twig used for searching for water. I still know about one person in my hometown who can do it, the others are dead.
          </p>
          <p  class="itw">
            That's interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that was kind of a starting point for my project last semester. We were working on the topic of data and I think I was overwhelmed with all the technological input that we got in the beginning of the semester. And I think that my reaction was to go back to what was before the technology. How did we get the data from nature, because we were focused on environmental data. And I thought this was a type of sensor. I don't know whether it works or not, or I don't even care. But there are people who do it and they think that it works. So I thought of it as a sensor used for finding water. And so then I was trying to find more examples and this led me to the animals, because we kind of use animals as sensors. When swallows fly low, you know that it's going to rain. When you learn how to observe nature, you can predict the weather.
          </p>
          <p  class="itw">
            Yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I got back to the dowsing twig with the electricity topic which I am working on now. I found an article that explains that probably these people, who know how to use the dowsing twig, react to changes in the electromagnetic field of the earth, because the water underground or the metals that they were looking for, affect them. There was this whole science around it centuries back and they didn't know electricity then. So the way they describe it is completely different, it's more magical.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            That's very interesting. It’s nice that you have this connection between the previous project and this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel like I didn't finish the last one. I just wrote the text, but then I wasn't  able to do anything with it.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            Can you maybe tell me more about this picture?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, the picture itself, or what’s in the pictures is not that important. It's more about the technique which is called spirit duplicating. And it's done with an old printing machine for duplicating things from carbon paper. The one we used as children for drawing.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            Yes, I remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I found this picture of old telegraph poles that were reflecting in a lake. But it got stuck in the machine because it was too black. And it kind of folded and made this lightning.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            Okay, so it looks like electricity.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was a good coincidence. Also the starting point for this topic was that I found out that there are these things called the red sprites. They appear during storms, but they are above clouds so you can never see them. You can only take a picture of them from space. The name ‘red stripe’ means spirit. And then I found out that there is this machine, the spirit duplicator. So it somehow feels that it all makes sense together. So later when I have something to print I would like to use this technique. It only prints in this one dark purple blue colour of the carbon paper, which is also nice.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            And then you have this book you had at the exhibition in the Maritime Museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I also have one more thing from that exhibition. It is this metal lunchbox. I had it there as a part of the scenography. I found out that in the film Solaris, the main character, Kelvin, takes this lunchbox carrying a plant from the Earth inside to the spaceship. I did the same thing before when moving to Iceland. I took a small fern that I still have here, I took a small piece of the fern I have at my mother’s place, I thought it does not need much light so I can take it to Iceland.
