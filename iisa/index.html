          <p>In this project I am looking into my familyâ€™s Karelian heritage
            and the transmitting and disappearing of cultural information
            through generations, especially regarding the history of my
            grandparents refuging from Karelia. I am exploring this
            subject through archival images, interviews of my family and
            material experimentation in the form of wearable artifacts.</p>
          <p>Through material I explore, arrange and let myself be guided
            by the information the material gives me. For the moment I
            don't have a specific expectation about the final product, but
            there are many methods and techniques that I would like to
            start with and see where they take me.</p>
          <p>Right now I am working on a piece of jewellery: a necklace
            that I am designing on a cast made after my chest. After this
            I will move on to textile experiments with printing and
            distressing with laser cutting. All of this is organized around a
            collection of old photographs.</p>
          <p>As this is a personal theme with many sensitive and even
            political layers, I want to approach it with care and time. I'm
            planning to continue this project in Finland and see this
            semester only as a starting point.</p>
