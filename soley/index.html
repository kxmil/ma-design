            So, I realized the ridiculous amounts of imported
            materials in Iceland and if you look around here, there's not a
            single thing that is from Iceland. Everything is shipped or
            flown here. But of course, it has its reasons. Iceland doesn't
            produce a lot of materials, but there is a lot of potential here.
            Currently, I'm looking at projects that are trying to find new
            ways to make materials and I'm investigating the drivers and
            obstacles in producing new materials with local resources. We
            have these big factories here that produce aluminium that is
            all shipped out of the country, but then we don't produce
            anything for ourselves. So, I mean, there is the capacity for
            doing big things here, but we are not using it for the right
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we shouldn't make factories. We should do
            multiple smaller productions
            and we should use more resources instead of draining only
            few of them like we are doing now.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have started taking Interviews with people who are making
            materials, sustainable materials. People who are challenging
            the way that we look at materials around us. We have
            companies that are working on algae and hemp plastic,
            lupine material and hempcrete.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm connecting with them and trying to figure out where
            these projects stand and trying to imagine from that what the
            future might look like and how the changed material use can
            be accelerated.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            So, you think that cost is stopping them from going
            into full production?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah, I think it could be a part of it.
            Then it's perhaps a question if the market is ready to spend
            more money on sustainable materials. You have to be quite
            sure about the feasibility of what you're doing. I don't think I
            can answer that question, but I know that the market is
            starting to see the profit in being more sustainable.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            Do you think the government could help with, for
            example, giving money to people that are using sustainable
            resources?
          </p>
          <p>
            I mean, I think it would be a great idea. The
            government is already doing similar things by lowering the
            cost of electric cars for example. So, I think that would be
            really nice, but I'm not a politician so I cannot control that but
            as a citizen, I would definitely support that.
            But a platform should be accessible to people who are, for
            example, building a house or a project requiring a lot of
            materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially for people who are not familiar with this category
            of materials. Maybe if you have never had an interest in this
            before to show what's available or what's possible with non-conventional materials.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            And you want to create this platform?
          </p>
          <p>
            In some way, yes. I will start with the master's thesis
            and see where it leads me. For example, a material library or
            any collection of existing materials is missing in Iceland.
          </p>
          <p class="itw">
            Yeah, but I mean, you can create a website database
            then speak about the topic and spread awareness, so more
            people know your website and I mean Iceland is not big.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exactly. Iceland has such a small population. But still,
            we are one of the biggest polluters in Europe per capita.
            We're importing so much and I'm not saying this because I'm
            a nationalist and I only want to use Icelandic products. But I
            think it's better to use local products in many ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            I just think it's important that we change how we think about
            materials. What has to last for 100 years and what can last
            two weeks?
          </p>
          <p>
            But the first thing everyone should do before creating new
            solutions is to use less and reuse and be aware of the
            impacts the materials we use have on the environment.
